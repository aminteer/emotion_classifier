# Emotion Detection Classification - Setting up a possible depression language detector
In a text heavy communication business with the general public, such as one that has a chatbot interface, it can be important to detect patterns of depression or possible intent of self-harm in communications.  Technology has advanced to where some of this monitoring can be automated based on language patterns used. 

This project is an exploration of potentional machine learning models that could detection emotions based on short text interactions.  The source of the data is a labeled set of ~40k tweets.  Initial attempts will see if unsupervised methods will result in clusters similar to the labeled categories.  Later exploratory modeling will focus on supervised learning techniques for comparison.
